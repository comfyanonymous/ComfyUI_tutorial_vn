# ComfyUI Tutorial VN (WIP)

A Tutorial VN for ComfyUI made with ComfyUI. Still work in progress...

[Link if you want to play it in your browser](https://comfyanonymous.github.io/ComfyUI_tutorial_vn/)

If you want to see the specific workflow used to create any of the images 
(eg: "game/images/teacher grin.png")
start up ComfyUI, and then just drag-n-drop the PNG file into it. 
The workflow is actually encoded into the EXIF data inside the PNG image, and will be automatically decoded.

Warning: The workflow looks more scary than it really is, because a single workflow is used to generate multiple images.
If you watch the Visual Novel, you will understand better how to parse out the pieces you are actually interested in.
